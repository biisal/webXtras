    - On Windows:  
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```  
    - On Linux/macOS:  
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```  

3. **Install backend dependencies**  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
